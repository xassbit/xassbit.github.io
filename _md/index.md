#Hi, I'm [Daniel](bio.html)
Welcome to my online CV.

#I have a very particular set of skills
I enjoy solving problems in the fields of technology and creativity by understanding their systems and languages.
##I speak the languages of machines...
Since very young I was interested in the use of technology to help with facilitating tasks. For that reason I have learned web and software development, as well as a set of tools in the form of apps and online services which help me managing my time and my business.
