<h1>Hi, I&#8217;m <a href="bio.html">Daniel</a></h1>

<p>Welcome to my online curriculum. This website was coded by me and it&#8217;s hosted on <a href="https://github.com/xassbit/xassbit.github.io">GitHub</a> using <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>.</p>

<h2>I&#8217;m looking for a job</h2>

<p><strong>I am currently looking for a position as a software developer</strong> - primarily - or as a web developer or as a time/project management coach.</p>

<h2>Summary and site navigation</h2>

<p>I learned software development during my <a href="education.html#edu-porto">BSc course in physics</a>, particularly Python with the module SciPy. Later I learned C and C++ during my <a href="education.html#edu-nijmegen">studies at the Radboud University</a>. I thought myself how to program in Swift, a language I have a lot of interest in, and <a href="education.html#edu-lynda">took online courses on that subject</a>. My skills in software development are summarised here:</p>

<h4><a href="skills/software.html">Software development skills</a></h4>

<p>I was since very young age interested in web development and web design. I have design the <a href="skills/web.html#web-jam">websites of my current ventures</a> and I built this online CV with HTML and CSS. My skills in web development and web design are summarised here:</p>

<h4><a href="skills/web.html">Web development skills</a></h4>

<p>A good developer is someone who is good at identifying and solving problems. I have a lot of experience on that since I have worked professionally in many creative fields. My skills on those fields are summarised here:</p>

<h4><a href="skills/video.html">Video skills</a></h4>

<h4><a href="skills/design.html">Graphic design skills</a></h4>

<p>One of my key strengths is the ability to explain concepts in an uncomplicated fashion by deconstructing them and explaining their parts. I have tutored and coached, and mostly I have taught disciplines in the field of music. My skills concerning teaching are summarised here:</p>

My skills concerning administration are summarised here:</p>
